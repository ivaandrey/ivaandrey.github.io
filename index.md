## About Me ##
𝐀𝐈 𝐀𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫 with 𝟏𝟕+ 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 in 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 and 𝐝𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠, driving solutions from 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 to 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 that deliver measurable product and business impact.
At 𝐁𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬, I combine 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬-𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 with 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩, building advanced vision modules for 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞, 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝 and 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐝𝐞:
• 𝐏𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐕/𝐃𝐋 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬, transforming research into production
• 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐠𝐚𝐳𝐞 𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐛𝐲 𝟖% across diverse devices
• 𝐀𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝟏𝟓𝟎 𝐅𝐏𝐒 in real-time hand tracking and motion detection
• 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 ~𝟎.𝟓𝐦𝐦 lens measurement accuracy, enabling accurate lens size calculation from a single RGB image
Previously at 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐒𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞, I advanced 𝐨𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 and 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐡 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬 for 𝐋𝐢𝐃𝐀𝐑 and 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐡 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐬, developing a 𝐘𝐎𝐋𝐎𝐯𝟑-based model with ~𝟗𝟓% 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 on objects as small as 𝟏𝟑𝐦𝐦.
Earlier at 𝐑𝐚𝐟𝐚𝐞𝐥 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬 and 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧, I engineered 𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞-𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞 𝐂𝐕 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬 and conducted 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡, building expertise in 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 and cross-functional collaboration.
I thrive in roles blending 𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩, 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩, and 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐈 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭.

## Education  ##
### - Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Vision & Image Processing ###
<img src="images/tel_aviv_university_logo_border.jpg?raw=true" width="5%" height="5%"/>

**[Tel Aviv University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/tel-aviv-university/) : 2012**

My M.Sc. research focused on **Object Tracking by Online Adaptive AdaBoost Classifiers**

[*Tracking by Online Adaptive AdaBoost Classifiers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SY7zlmDr0M) is a machine learning-based object tracking approach that dynamically adapts over time using AdaBoost classifiers. It is particularly effective for tracking objects in real-time video streams, even when appearance changes due to lighting variations, occlusions, and motion blur.

The core of my approach involves the online selection of the most discriminative Haar-like features, which enables the tracker to effectively separate the target from the surrounding background. This method formulates tracking as a classification problem, leveraging boosting techniques and online learning to develop a classifier that can continuously adapt and distinguish the target from its environment.


### - Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering ###
