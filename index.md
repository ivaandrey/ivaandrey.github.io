My M.Sc. research focused on **Object Tracking by Online Adaptive AdaBoost Classifiers**

[*Tracking by Online Adaptive AdaBoost Classifiers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SY7zlmDr0M) is a machine learning-based object tracking approach that dynamically adapts over time using AdaBoost classifiers. It is particularly effective for tracking objects in real-time video streams, even when appearance changes due to lighting variations, occlusions, and motion blur.

The core of my approach involves the online selection of the most discriminative Haar-like features, which enables the tracker to effectively separate the target from the surrounding background. This method formulates tracking as a classification problem, leveraging boosting techniques and online learning to develop a classifier that can continuously adapt and distinguish the target from its environment.
