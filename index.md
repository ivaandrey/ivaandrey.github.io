##### Tracking by Online Adaptive AdaBoost Classifiers #####

This method is a machine learning-based object tracking method that adapts dynamically over time using AdaBoost classifiers. It is particularly useful for tracking objects in real-time video streams where appearance changes due to lighting, occlusions, and motion blur.
The main approach in my work involves online feature selection, which discriminates the target from the surrounding background. This approach treats tracking as a classification problem, utilizing boosting methods and online learning to develop a classifier capable of distinguishing the target from the background.
