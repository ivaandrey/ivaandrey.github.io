## Mimimal Object Size Detection in Depth Images ##

Image quality analysis in depth cameras is essential for ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and overall performance of computer vision systems that depend on depth sensing. Typical image quality (IQ) metrics used to evaluate depth image quality include depth accuracy and precision, temporal noise (Z-noise), edge sharpness, among others.  
One important metric is the **Minimal Object Size (MOS)**, which refers to the smallest physical object that can be reliably detected, measured, or recognized by a depth sensor. This metric is especially critical in applications such as surveillance, robotics, quality inspection, and biometric systems, where fine detail detection is essential.

I led the development of the Minimal Object Size (MOS) metric for the Intel RealSense LiDAR L515 cameraâ€”a compact, solid-state depth camera based on LiDAR technology, designed for high-accuracy, low-power depth sensing in indoor environments. This metric enabled precise evaluation of the smallest detectable object size, enhancing depth image quality analysis and system performance.
