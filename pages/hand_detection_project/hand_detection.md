## Hand Detection and Hand Landmark Estimation  ##

The gaze estimation activity I lead involves managing a team focused on developing advanced deep learning models for gaze tracking. I oversee the **research, development, optimization, and deployment** of of these models. My responsibilities include **technical leadership**, covering **algorithm design, model training, dataset curation, and performance evaluation**. Additionally, our team supports **deployment and integration into SDKs** to ensure robust and accurate gaze estimation for various applications, including **driver monitoring systems (DMS) and human-computer interaction (HCI)**.

We develop gaze estimation models for various screen sizes, ranging from **phones and tablets to monitors as large as 55"**. These models demonstrate high robustness, delivering **small prediction errors up to 5% of screen size**, with an **execution time of approximately 5.5 milliseconds (180 FPS) on a CPU**.
