## Hand Detection and Hand Landmark Estimation  ##

**Hand Detection** involves identifying and localizing hands in images or video streams. **Hand Landmark Estimation** focuses on identifying key points on the hand, such as fingertips, knuckles, and the wrist, enabling detailed tracking of hand movements. Both of these modules are essential for applications such as gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), and human-computer interaction (HCI).
