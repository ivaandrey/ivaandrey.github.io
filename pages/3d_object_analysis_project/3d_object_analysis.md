## 3D Object Edge Analysis ##

**Edge analysis** is an important image quality metric in depth imaging, used to evaluate the sharpness and clarity of object boundaries captured by a depth camera. This metric assesses how accurately and consistently the system captures depth discontinuities, such as the transition between foreground objects and the background.  
Key aspects of edge analysis in depth images:
+ **Sharpness**:
+ **Bumpiness**:
+ **Distortion**:

In addition, analysis of side plane of the object and corner were added to the list
