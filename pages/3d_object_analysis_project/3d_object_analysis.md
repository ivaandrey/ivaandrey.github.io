## 3D Object Edge Analysis ##

**Edge analysis** is an important image quality metric in depth imaging, used to evaluate the **sharpness**, **clarity** and **geometric accuracy** of object boundaries captured by a depth camera. This metric assesses how accurately and consistently the system captures depth discontinuities, such as the transition between foreground objects and the background.  

### üìè Key Metrics for Edge Analysis: ###
+ **Sharpness**: Measures the steepness or gradient at depth boundaries, indicating how well the sensor can preserve the true geometry of edges.
+ **Bumpiness**: Quantifies local irregularities or high-frequency noise along edges ‚Äî areas where depth values change sharply.
+ **Distortion**: Refers to systematic deviations in the shape or geometry of a depth edge from its expected form. It typically arises when an edge that should be straight, sharp, or well-aligned appears warped, curved, displaced, or smeared.

In addition to standard edge metrics, I developed two novel metrics to enhance edge quality assessment.  
### ‚ú® Novel Metrics Developed ###
+ **Side Plane Angle Metric**: Calculates the normals of different regions along a side plane and analyzes the angular deviations to assess surface consistency and flatness.
+ **Corner Angle Metric**: Measures the angle between adjacent planar surfaces at object corners along an edge, evaluating the sharpness and geometric accuracy of depth discontinuities in corner regions.

Two depth cameras based on different technologies were selected for analysis: the **RealSense LiDAR L515** and the **RealSense D435**.

The **L515** utilizes LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology, employing a laser scanning mechanism to capture high-resolution depth information. It provides exceptional depth accuracy and low noise, especially in indoor environments, and is well-suited for applications requiring fine-grained depth details such as object measurement or high-precision scanning.

In contrast, the **D435** is based on stereo vision technology, using a pair of RGB sensors and an infrared projector to compute depth via disparity between images. While more versatile across various lighting conditions and typically offering a wider field of view, it is generally less accurate and noisier compared to LiDAR in terms of depth precision, particularly at longer ranges or on low-texture surfaces.

To analyze the angles of the plane and the corner, the 3D coordinates of each pixel were calculated, and a 3D model of the object was reconstructed. The side plane was divided into 25 regions, and a plane-fitting algorithm was applied to each region to calculate the normal vector for each.

+ The D435 camera demonstrated more accurate and precise results in the **Side Plane Angle** analysis, with an average angle of 89.8¬∞ and a standard deviation of 4.8¬∞, compared to the L515, which showed an average angle of 93.4¬∞ with a standard deviation of 16.2¬∞.

+ A similar trend was observed in the **Corner Angle** analysis, where the D435 camera produced more accurate average results with an angle of 93.2¬∞, compared to the Lidar L515, which measured an average angle of 79.8¬∞

To summarize the results of all 3D object edge analysis metrics, the stereo-based D435 camera consistently achieved more precise and accurate results compared to the LiDAR-based L515.
