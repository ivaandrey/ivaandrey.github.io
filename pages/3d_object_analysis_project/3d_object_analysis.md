## 3D Object Edge Analysis ##

**Edge analysis** is an important image quality metric in depth imaging, used to evaluate the sharpness and clarity of object boundaries captured by a depth camera. This metric assesses how accurately and consistently the system captures depth discontinuities, such as the transition between foreground objects and the background.  
Key aspects of edge analysis in depth images:
+ **Sharpness**: Measures the steepness or gradient at depth boundaries, indicating how well the sensor can preserve the true geometry of edges.
+ **Bumpiness**: Quantifies local irregularities or high-frequency noise along edges â€” areas where depth values change sharply.
+ **Distortion**: Refers to systematic deviations in the shape or geometry of a depth edge from its expected form. It typically arises when an edge that should be straight, sharp, or well-aligned appears warped, curved, displaced, or smeared.

In addition, analysis of side plane of the object and corner were added to the list
