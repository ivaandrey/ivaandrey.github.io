## 3D Object Edge Analysis ##

**Edge analysis** is an important image quality metric in depth imaging, used to evaluate the sharpness and clarity of object boundaries captured by a depth camera. This metric assesses how accurately and consistently the system captures depth discontinuities, such as the transition between foreground objects and the background.
