## Glasses Lens Measurement for Optometric Applications ##

Accurate **glasses lens measurement** is vital in optometry, ensuring prescription lenses deliver optimal vision correction and comfort. Whether for single-vision, bifocal, or progressive lenses, precise fitting aligns the optical center of the lens with the pupil, minimizing discomfort and maximizing visual clarity.

### üìè Key Frame Measurements for Optimal Fit: ###
+ **üëÅÔ∏è Pupillary Distance (PD)**: Ensures the optical centers of the lenses align perfectly with the wearer‚Äôs pupils for maximum clarity and reduced eye strain.
+ **üìê Lens Width and Height**: Determines the size of the lens to provide proper coverage and a balanced visual experience.
+ **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Fitting Height (FH)**: The vertical positioning of the lenses, ensuring that the wearer looks through the optical center for proper vision correction, especially important for progressive and bifocal lenses.

Despite advancements in optometric technology, **most optometrists today still perform these measurements manually using a ruler or pupillometer**. While this method has been widely used for decades and provides reasonable accuracy, it is prone to human error, leading to slight misalignments in lens placement.

To address these limitations, **I led a project focused on developing precise lens measurements from RGB images using classical and deep learning (DL) computer vision methods**. These advanced techniques allow for accurate, automated measurements that reduce human error and improve efficiency. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques, digital solutions can now extract key parameters such as **PD and MonoPD, Lens Height and Width, and Fitting Height (FH)** dimensions with superior precision compared to traditional manual methods.

The developed algorithm modules demonstrate highly accurate results, with an **average error of up to ~0.5mm** in both MonoPD and Fitting Height calculations.

### üîç Lens Size Calculation Pipeline: ###

**‚û§ Face Detection** - Detect the face in the input image using a deep learning-based face detector. A custom-trained YOLOv5 network is utilized for this task. 

**‚û§ Face Landmark Detection** - Identify key facial landmarks (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth, and face contour) using a landmark detection model. We train a multi-branch regression model to accurately estimate face landmarks

**‚û§ Glasses Region Extraction** - Using eyes and nose landmarks define the crop of the glasses.

**‚û§ Glasses Symmetry Line Calculation** - Determine the position of the glasses' symmetry line using classical computer vision techniques. This involves processing the gradient image and applying a correlation-based method.

**‚û§ Iris Center Calculation** - Detect the iris centers using a trained regression model for iris landmark estimation. Accurately localizing the centers is essential for measuring interpupillary distance (IPD) and fitting height.

**‚û§ Monocular Pupillary Distance (MonoPD) Calculation** - Compute the distance from each iris center to the symmetry line of the glasses. This measurement is used for personalized lens fitting and prescription accuracy.

**‚û§ Glasses Lens Segmentation** - Segment the lens region within the glasses frame using a trained segmentation network based on the [YOLACT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02689) architecture. Extract lens contours to enable precise size estimation.

**‚û§ Lens Size and Fitting Height Calculation** - Measure the lens dimensions (width and height) in pixels based on the extracted lens contours.
   
**‚û§ Calculate the Fitting Height (FH)** - Compute the vertical distance from the iris center to the bottom of the lens.

**‚û§ Pixel-to-Millimeter Conversion** - Convert all measured values from pixels to millimeters using a predefined scaling factor or depth information from a depth image.
