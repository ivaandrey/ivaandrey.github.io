## Glasses Lens Measurement for Optometric Applications ##

Accurate *glasses lens measurement* is a critical aspect of optometry, ensuring that prescription eyewear provides optimal vision correction, comfort, and long-term wearability. Whether for single-vision, bifocal, progressive, or specialized lenses, precise measurements are essential for aligning the optical center of the lenses with the wearer's eyes. Even minor misalignments can lead to visual discomfort, headaches, and reduced effectiveness of the prescription.
