## Glasses Lens Measurement for Optometric Applications ##

Accurate **glasses lens measurement** is a critical aspect of optometry, ensuring that prescription eyewear provides optimal vision correction, comfort, and long-term wearability. Whether for single-vision, bifocal, progressive, or specialized lenses, precise measurements are essential for aligning the optical center of the lenses with the wearer's eyes. Even minor misalignments can lead to visual discomfort, headaches, and reduced effectiveness of the prescription.

**Key Frame Measurements for Optimal Fit:**
+ **Pupillary Distance (PD)**: Ensures the optical centers of the lenses align perfectly with the wearerâ€™s pupils for maximum clarity and reduced eye strain.
+ **Lens Width and Height**: Determines the size of the lens to provide proper coverage and a balanced visual experience.
+ **Fitting Height (FH)**: The vertical positioning of the lenses, ensuring that the wearer looks through the optical center for proper vision correction, especially important for progressive and bifocal lenses.

Despite advancements in optometric technology, **most optometrists today still perform these measurements manually using a ruler or pupillometer**. While this method has been widely used for decades and provides reasonable accuracy, it is prone to human error, leading to slight misalignments in lens placement.

To address these limitations, **I led a project focused on developing precise lens measurements from RGB images using classical and deep learning (DL) computer vision methods**. These advanced techniques allow for accurate, automated measurements that reduce human error and improve efficiency. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques, digital solutions can now extract key parameters such as PD and MonoPD, Lens Height and Width, and Fitting Height (FH) dimensions with superior precision compared to traditional manual methods.
