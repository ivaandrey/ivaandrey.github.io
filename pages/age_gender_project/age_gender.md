## Age and Gender Estimation ##

**Age and gender estimation** from facial images is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in security, marketing, human-computer interaction, and social analytics. The goal is to automatically predict a person's age and gender based on their facial features, leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Traditional approaches relied on handcrafted features and classical machine learning models, but modern methods predominantly use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models learn complex facial representations and can generalize across diverse demographics and real-world conditions.

Despite significant advancements, challenges remain due to variations in lighting, pose, facial expressions, face occlusions, as well as headwear and eyewear.
