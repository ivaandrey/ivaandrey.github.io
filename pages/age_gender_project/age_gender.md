## Age and Gender Estimation ##

**Age and gender estimation** from facial images is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in security, marketing, human-computer interaction, and social analytics. The goal is to automatically predict a person's age and gender based on their facial features using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The task is highly challenging due to variations in lighting, pose, facial expressions, face occlusions, as well as headwear and eyewear.

As part of my role in the company, I led the development of age and gender estimation networks. This project involved creating highly accurate models capable of estimating an individual's age and gender from images, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In addition to training and evaluating the models, one of my key responsibilities was the creation of diverse and high-quality datasets, ensuring that the models were trained on data representing real-world variations. I guided the entire process, from initial research and algorithm design to model training and deployment. The resulting models achieved an **accuracy of 88% [1-Class Off Accuracy (1CoA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08186) for age estimation and 99% accuracy for gender classification**, demonstrating their robustness and reliability in real-world applications.

+ **Face embeddings**: To address the problem of age and gender estimation, I decided to use facial embeddings as input for the models. Face embeddings are compact, high-dimensional feature representations extracted from a face image using deep learning models. Several pre-trained deep learning models can be used to extract facial embeddings. These models are designed to convert a face image into a fixed-size feature vector that captures facial identity. The [ArcFace (InsightFace)](https://insightface.ai/arcface?utm_source=chatgpt.com) network was used to create embeddings of faces. The model generates 512-dimensional embeddings, providing a good balance between feature richness and computational efficiency. ArcFace introduces Additive Angular Margin Loss (AAM), which enhances feature discrimination, ensuring that embeddings for different individuals are well-separated.
+ **Training Data**: Training an accurate age/gender estimation models requires diverse and well-labeled datasets. I used several publicly available datasets to train our age and gender estimation models, including:
++ IMDB-WIKI: ~500,000 images with age and gender labels, though some noisy data due to incorrect birthdates.

 + UTKFace: ~20,000 images with age, gender, and ethnicity labels, offering diverse variations.

 + Adience: ~26,000 images focused on age and gender classification across different age groups.

 + MORPH2: ~55,000 images with age, gender, and race labels, ideal for high-accuracy tasks.

 + FG-NET: ~1,002 images used for age progression and regression tasks.
