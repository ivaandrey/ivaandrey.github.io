## Artificial Trainer - mentored B.Sc. students' final project ##

Throughout my engineering career, I’ve always aimed to help others in STEM fields by explaining concepts and sharing my knowledge. I had the opportunity to support a pair of students in their final B.Sc. project at Braude College of Engineering (Karmiel). The project intrigued me as it combined algorithmic thinking with computer vision using a deep learning approach—two areas I’m deeply passionate about. **The project received a final mark of 96.**

The main goal of the project was to create an **Artificial Trainer** that acts as a supervisor for individuals training without a personal trainer in the gym. The artificial trainer detects the trainee and **assesses the performance of the squat exercise in real time from an RGB image**. The correctness of the exercise is assessed using **MediaPipe and CNN deep learning models**. It compares the trainee’s movements to a defined range of correct form and provides a performance rating. Additionally, the artificial trainer sends alerts when the exercise is performed incorrectly, helping the trainee avoid injuries and enhance their performance.
