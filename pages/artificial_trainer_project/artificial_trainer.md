## Artificial Trainer - AI Real-Time Squat Coach ##

Throughout my engineering career, **I‚Äôve aimed to support others in STEM by sharing knowledge and mentorship**. I had the privilege of guiding two outstanding B.Sc. students in their final-year project at Braude College of Engineering (Karmiel). This project merged algorithmic thinking and computer vision with deep learning‚Äîfields.

**üèÜ The project received a final mark of 96.**

The main goal of the project was to create an **Artificial Trainer**‚Äîa virtual supervisor for individuals training at the gym without a coach. Leveraging **MediaPipe** and CNN models, the app detects squat exercises in **real time from RGB images**, evaluates form correctness against predefined criteria, and delivers instant feedback to help prevent injury and enhance performance.

To accurately evaluate the exercise and assess the user‚Äôs performance, it is essential to define specific requirements for the squat exercise ‚Äî including correct movement patterns, acceptable ranges, and movement limits.

### üîß Key Capabilities: ###
+  **Repetition Counting** ‚Äì Detects and tracks each squat repetition automatically.  
+  **Real-Time Feedback** ‚Äì Highlights form errors and provides corrective guidance on-the-fly.  
+  **Performance Scoring** ‚Äì Calculates a score for each repetition and the entire set.


The solution combines pose detection analysis with a deep learning approach. Most of the algorithmic modules are based on calculating angles between key joints, which are extracted using the MediaPipe network. To determine whether a squat repetition is correctly performed, we defined five key criteria. Additionally, a dedicated repetition detection module was developed, which relies on analyzing the knee angle span.

### ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria: ###
+ **Repetition Definition**: A valid squat begins and ends in a standing position, with a deep bend detected via knee angle dynamics.
+ **Back Straightness Criteria**: A CNN-based classifier evaluates whether the back remains straight throughout the motion.
+ **Knee Alignment**: Ensures knees stay aligned with or behind the toes, assessed via 2D joint coordinates.
+ **Heel Positioning**: Detects if heels lift off the ground, maintaining stability and form.
+ **Head Positioning**: Evaluates head posture via neck-to-back angle to ensure proper alignment.
+ **Depth of Squat**: Assessed by knee angle; insufficient depth indicates poor form.

One challenging part was designing a lightweight CNN for back posture classification‚Äîa necessity since the system had to run on a CPU-only laptop in real time. After testing, the final model achieved **87.98% accuracy** on the test set while maintaining **44 FPS** runtime.

###  üß© Back Straightness Classifier: ###

One challenging part was designing a lightweight CNN for back posture classification‚Äîa necessity since the system had to run on a CPU-only laptop in real time. Most well-known pretrained classification networks suffer from poor runtime performance, so after analyzing the project requirements, **we decided to implement, train and deploy an efficient, classic CNN architecture using binary cross-entropy loss.** Additionaly, the students were guided on how to collect relevant data for both straight and curved backs.  
+ The final trained model achieves:
  + üìä **87.98% accuracy** on the test set.
  + üöÄ **Real-time performance at 44 FPS** on CPU.

### ‚ö° Real-Time Application: ###

The developed application operates in **real time on CPU**, analyzing the correctness of each squat repetition, **providing instant feedback to the trainee** on necessary improvements, **counting repetitions**, and summarizing the overall execution quality at the end of the set. Additionally, it **returns an overall performance grade**, saves the results, and enables the trainee to track their progress over time.
