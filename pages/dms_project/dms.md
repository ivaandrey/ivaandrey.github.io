## Driver activity recognition for Driver Monitoring System (DMS) ##

A **Driver Monitoring System (DMS)** is an advanced safety technology designed to track and analyze a driver's behavior in real time. Using cameras and AI-based algorithms, DMS can detect signs of fatigue, distraction, drowsiness, or inattentiveness by monitoring facial expressions, eye movements, head position, and even physiological signals.
